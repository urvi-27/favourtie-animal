 <h2>Panda Description</h2>
    Giant pandas have a distinctive black and white coat, with black fur around their eyes and on their ears, 
    muzzle, legs and shoulders. Their thick, wooly coat helps to keep them warm in their cool mountain homes. 
    An adult panda can weigh up to 150kg, with males 10% larger and 20% heavier than females.
 <h2>History Of Panda</h2>
 <p>
    Giant Pandas were first introduced to the West in 1869 when a panda pelt and skeleton were sent to Paris by 
    the French zoologist and priest, Father Armand David. Long before Western cultures embraced the lovable 
    black and white panda, they were a staple figure in Chinese art dating back thousands of years. Giant 
    Pandas became known to the world in 1936 when Ruth Harkness captured a nine week old panda cub and brought 
    it to the USA.
 </p>
 <p>
    Her husband Bill had previously traveled to China to search for a living panda but failed to find one 
    before he died. Ruth took up the search with the help of Chinese-American explorer Quentin Young and their
    search produced the panda cub they named Su-Lin. The worlds infatuation of the black and white panda was 
    born.
 </p>
 <p>
    Panda bears were originally thought to be a member of the raccoon or cat family.  In the 1970’s, DNA showed 
    it to be a member of the bear family.  Estimates put its wild population at 1100 which, kicked into gear
    conservationists from around the world.  Later estimates would increase this number to around 1600, mainly
    due to more precise estimations rather than an increase in population.  In the 1980’s they were officially 
    declared an endangered species.

 <h2>Facts Of Panda</h2>
 <p>
    <div class="highlight">
    <h4>1. THEY HAVE GREAT CAMOUFLAGE FOR THEIR ENVIRONMENT</h4> 
    </div>
    The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.  
    Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats. The arms and
    legs are black, helping it to hide in shade. 
 </p>
 <p>
     <div class="highlight">
     <h4>THEIR EYES ARE DIFFERENT TO NORMAL BEARS</h4>
     </div>
     Like domestic cats, giant pandas have vertical slits for pupils.
 </p>
 <p>
     <div class="highlight">
     <h4>3. CUBS ARE WELL PROTECTED IN THEIR FIRST MONTH</h4>
     </div>
     Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - with the cub
     resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head. 
 </p>
 <p>
     <div class="highlight">
         <h4>4.COURAGEOUS CUBS!</h4>
     </div>
     At 5 months old, giant pandas learn how to climb - sometimes practicing by climbing on their mum.
 </p>
 <p>
     <div class="highlight">
         <h4>5.A HELPING HAND</h4>
     </div>
     They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food.
 </p>
 <p>
     <div class="highlight">
         <h4>6.THEY SPEND A LOT OF THEIR DAY EATING</h4>
     </div>
    Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo. 
 </p>
 <p>
     <div class="highlight">
         <h4>7.BAMBOO IS CRITICAL TO THEIR DIET</h4>
     </div>
     Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation
 </p>
 <p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <h4>8.BUT THEY DO OCCASIONALLY EAT SOMETHING OTHER THAN BAMBOO</h4>
    </div>
    Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their
    diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin, 
    kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food. 
</p>
<p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <h4>9.PANDAS SOMETIMES DO HANDSTANDS WHEN THEY WEE!</h4>
    </div>
    Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a 
    full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up. 
</p>
<p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <h4>10.THEY LIKE TO KEEP IT REGULAR</h4>
    </div>
    On average, pandas poo 40 times a day.
</p>
<h2>Summary About Pandas</h2>
Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost 
entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo 
they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.
